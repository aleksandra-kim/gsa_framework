class UncertainGraphTraversal(object):
    """
    Traverse a supply chain, following paths of greatest impact and uncertainty.

    The degree of uncertainty is measured with:
    1) standard-deviation-to-mean (coefficient of variation) or
    2) variance-to-mean (index of dispersion)

    This implementation uses a queue of datasets to assess. As the supply chain is traversed, datasets inputs are added to a list sorted by LCA score. Each activity in the sorted list is assessed, and added to the supply chain graph, as long as its impact is above a certain threshold, and the maximum number of calculations has not been exceeded.

    Because the next dataset assessed is chosen by its impact, not its position in the graph, this is neither a breadth-first nor a depth-first search, but rather "importance-first".

    This class is written in a functional style - no variables are stored in *self*, only methods.

    Should be used by calling the ``calculate`` method.

    .. warning:: Graph traversal with multioutput processes only works when other inputs are substituted (see `Multioutput processes in LCA <http://chris.mutel.org/multioutput.html>`__ for a description of multiputput process math in LCA).
