1. SALib package should be installed via pip, rather than conda-forge, as it seems more updated in pip:
pip install SALib

2. SALib is funny in that they check whether the seed is given by users like this: `if seed`,
which means that seed=0 would be regarded as no seed. at least in the FAST sampling

### TODO ###

1. Generate documentation using Sphinx:
    Numpy style docs: https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html
    https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#documenting-classes
    https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/
    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

2. Implement parameterized LCA model based on presamples.

3. Run remotely.

4. Comment tests properly

1. From Chris: Could require that sampler is a callable. Strings are nicer, especially for beginners.
